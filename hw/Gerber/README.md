# JLCPCB
There are gerber files for the PCB plus BOM and CPL files for ordering from JLCPCB SMT service in the JLCPCB folder. When ordering PCB Assembly, for the Tooling holes option, select "Added by Customer". I put the tooling holes under the usb port and under the serial port so you can't see them when the PCB is fully assembled. 

In the PCB viewer while ordering, it looks like the LEDs are backwards. They are not. I trusted that preview while ordering the first batch of PCBs and I spent quite some time de-soldering, flipping and re-soldering the LEDs.


# PCBWAY
There are gerber files for the PCB in the PCBWAY folder.

I'm still deciding which to use exactly but the TL;DR is

You can make your own for you and your friends.
You can fork and modify the hardware and software but keep the same license as the source.

You can not sell the hardware as your own.
You can not sell the software as your own. 
If you make your own hardware that works with this software, then sell your own hardware and credit the source of the software please.


Not that you'd want to use this in it's current state.
